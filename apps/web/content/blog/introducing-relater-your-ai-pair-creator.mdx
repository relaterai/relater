## What is Relater?

We're thrilled to introduce Relater—an open-source AI tool designed to be your ultimate partner for capturing, organizing, and rediscovering ideas across any type of content.

## Why Relater?   
We built Relater because:

Content overload is real: Bookmarks, PDFs, videos, and podcasts pile up, but valuable insights get lost.

Organization shouldn't be tedious: Traditional tagging systems feel rigid and time-consuming.

Privacy matters: Your thoughts and ideas deserve protection, not exploitation.

## What Relater Does
Relater acts as your AI-powered "second brain" to:

### Capture effortlessly
Save content from anywhere—webpages, YouTube videos, podcasts, PDFs, or images—with one click. Relater’s AI highlights key insights so you can focus on consuming, not note-taking.

### Organize naturally
Use #AI-powered multi-level tags (e.g., #Design/UI-Inspiration or #Research/AI-Ethics) to create a flexible knowledge hierarchy. The more you tag, the smarter Relater’s suggestions become.

### Find instantly
Search by meaning, not just keywords. Relater's AI vector search understands context, letting you ask things like:
“Find podcast clips about startup fundraising mistakes”
“Show me PDF sections discussing renewable energy trends”

### Preserve privacy
Your data stays yours. Relater is:

- Open-source: Audit or modify the code yourself.
- Self-hostable: Keep everything on your own device.
- Ad-free & zero tracking: We'll never sell your data.

For Anyone Who Thinks
Whether you're a:

- Researcher drowning in papers
- Creator curating inspiration
- Lifelong learner tired of forgotten bookmarks
- Privacy advocate wary of data-hungry tools
